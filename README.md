# Codings

The goal here is that each file demostrates a single concept in code.

## Index

- Different approaches to fibonacci [code](py/fibonacci.py)
- Hash table with separate chaining [code](py/hash_table.py)
- Initialize and reverse a linked list [code](py/reverse_linkedlist.py)

## Others

These are code samples by other folk that I include here for reference

- Max Connected colours in a grid [code](others/max_connected.py)
