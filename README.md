# Codings

The goal here is that each file demostrates a single concept in for
quick reference.

## Index

- Different approaches to fibonacci [fibonacci.py](py/fibonacci.py)
- Hash table with separate chaining [hash_table.py](py/hash_table.py)
- Initialize and reverse a linked list [reverse_linkedlist.py](py/reverse_linkedlist.py)
- Binary tree traversal [binary_tree_traversal.py](py/binary_tree_traversal.py)
- Quicksort [quicksort.py](py/quicksort.py)

## Others

These are code samples by other folk that I include here for reference

- Max Connected colours in a grid [code](others/max_connected.py)
- Basic sorting Algorithms [code](others/sorting_algos.py)
